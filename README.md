# [Off-the-shelf Embedded Devices as Platforms for Security Research](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3065913.3065919)

Eurosec 2017

The goal of this wiki is to gather and to share information about embedded
devices used by the research community.

# Current devices

The list with the current devices is provided on [this page](DEVICES.md).

# Submiting a new device

Feel free to submit information about new embedded devices by sending pull requests.

 1. Refrain to submit any copyrighted material.
 2. Specify the architecture and the instruction set.
 3. Evaluate if code execution (CE, *G1*), debug connection (Debug, *G3*) and a
communication channel/analysis (CC, *G2*) is achieved.
 4. Submit any links and descriptions regarding the process of transforming the
embedded device to research platform.
 5. Try to reference as much possible academic or non academic conferences.
 6. Try to get an accurrate model number with as much details as possible such
that the process is reproducible.
